# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Inverse-Laser-Cavity-Design
Implementation of genetic algorithm using Fenics for static analysis

- Methods to create state vectors for configuration of laser cavity 
- Default hole in configuration 
- Genetic algorithm with currently two possible criteria: largest deformation, u_max / deformation of average optical length, delta_L
